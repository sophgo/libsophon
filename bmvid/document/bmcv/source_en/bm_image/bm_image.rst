bm_image structure
==================

Bmcv api is operated around bm_image, with a bm_image object corresponding to a picture. Users can build bm_image objects through bm_image_create for the applications of each function of bmcv. Users need to destroy it through bm_image_destroy after usage.


bm_image
________


bm_image structure is defined as follows:

    .. code-block:: c

       struct bm_image {
           int width;
           int height;
           bm_image_format_ext image_format;
           bm_data_format_ext data_type;
           bm_image_private* image_private;
       };

bm_image structure covers the width and height of the image, the image format (image_format), image data format (data_type), and the private data of the structure.

bm_data_format_ext data_type
____________________________

data_type has the following enumeration types:

    .. code-block:: c

       typedef enum bm_image_data_format_ext_{
           DATA_TYPE_EXT_FLOAT32,
           DATA_TYPE_EXT_1N_BYTE,
           DATA_TYPE_EXT_4N_BYTE,
           DATA_TYPE_EXT_1N_BYTE_SIGNED,
           DATA_TYPE_EXT_4N_BYTE_SIGNED,
           DATA_TYPE_EXT_FP16,
           DATA_TYPE_EXT_BF16,
       }bm_image_data_format_ext;

**Description of incoming parameters:**

* DATA_TYPE_EXT_FLOAT32

  Indicating that the created image data format is single-precision floating-point number

* DATA_TYPE_EXT_1N_BYTE

  Indicating that the created image data format is ordinary unsigned 1N UINT8

* DATA_TYPE_EXT_4N_BYTE

  Indicating that the created image data format is 4N UINT8, that is, four unsigned INT8 image data are staggered. One bm_image object actually contains four pictures with the same attributes

* DATA_TYPE_EXT_1N_BYTE_SIGNED

  Indicating that the created image data format is ordinary signed 1N INT8

* DATA_TYPE_EXT_4N_BYTE_SIGNED

  Indicating that the created image data format is 4N INT8, that is, the four signed INT8 image data are staggered

* DATA_TYPE_EXT_FP16

  Indicating that the created image data format is a half-precision floating-point number. Use 5bit to represent the exponent and 10bit to represent the decimal

* DATA_TYPE_EXT_BF16

  Indicating that the created image data format is 16bit floating point number, which is actually truncated data for FLOAT32 single precision floating point number. Use 8bit to represent the exponent and 7bit to represent the decimal

- For 4N arrangement, please refer to the following figure:

.. image::  ./4N.png



As shown above, the 4Byte of the i-th position in the corresponding channel of the 4 1N format images are put together as a 32-bit DWORD as the value of the i-th position in the corresponding channel of the 4N format image.For example, a1/b1/c1/d1 in channel 1 synthesis x1; for cases with less than 4 maps, the placeholder in map x still needs to be preserved.

4N only supports RGB-related formats, not YUV-related formats and FORMAT_COMPRESSED.
